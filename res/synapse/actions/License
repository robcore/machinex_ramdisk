	The below Copyright applies to any of the scripts, json configurations,
	or anything else contained within the project that has been graciously
	lent to me via UpInTheAir.  I'd like to add that he's a good man and
	had to put up with some pretty ridiculous treatment by those who
	profited from his hard work, and I appreciate his kind nature :)

	Please note that this License has been added mainly for his awesome
	work with MDNIE/SCREEN related functions, and that the majority of work
	related to this Ramdisk has been a shared effort by myself, UpInTheAir,
	Andreilux, Dorimanx, Yank555, Friedrich420 (you will always be my
	brother in kernel development, and the first person to inspire me to
	do this), the whole Emotion team, and many others who I may have forgotten.

	If I've forgotten to mention anyone or credit them, please let me know and I
	will rectify that post-haste!

	Thanks to everyone involved, without you this old device would still be stuck
	in the dark ages.
